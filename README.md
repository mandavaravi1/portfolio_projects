[Link to Predicting Employee Attrition Rate](https://github.com/mandavaravi1/ML/tree/master/Report)

Employee attrition is a big problem many companies are facing nowadays. On boarding a
new employee can become expensive, resources consuming in terms of time, money and
sometimes may not even find a perfect replacement. Considering these factors, some of the
companies are trying to keep their employees happy and satisfied. One of the ways how to keep
employees from leaving is to analyze, why people who left the company decided to do
so, predict who could be leaving next and try to take actions for retention. The main objective is
to solve the problem by determining the factors that lead to attrition, predict the likeliness of
attrition and hence reduce the employees attrition based on results

- Implemented different models and picked the best model considering the parameters.

## Predicting dog breed using Deep learning techniques from trained dataset.

[Link to DogApp Project](https://github.com/mandavaravi1/DogApp_Project3)

In this project, I explored on CNN and learnt how to build a pipeline that can be used within a web to process real-world, user-supplied images. Given an image of a dog, the algorithm will identify an estimate of the canine’s breed. If supplied an image of a human, the code will identify the resembling dog breed. The goal to understand how image classification can be implemented with attained dataset using deep learning techniques.

## Finding Donors for Charity

[Link to Donors Project](https://github.com/mandavaravi1/finding_donors)

In this project I explored the census dataset to identify the people who are likely to donate for charity by using NumPy and Pandas, which are two popular Python packages used for manipulating datasets and applying preprocessing techniques.
The goal of this project is to apply severeal Supervised learning algorithms to the processed dataset and identify the best one that suits the reqirement.


## Predicting Boston Housing Prices using Linear Regression

[Link to Boston House Price Prediction Project](https://github.com/mandavaravi1/MachineLearning/tree/master/boston_housing)

In this project I investigated the performance and predictive power of a model that has been trained and tested on data collected from homes in suburbs of Boston, Massachusetts. A model trained on this data that is seen as a good fit could then be used to make certain predictions about a home — in particular, its monetary value. This model would prove to be invaluable for someone like a real estate agent who could make use of such information on a daily basis.

- Implemented the model using Linear, Ridge and Lasso Regression & achieved a root mean square error of 4.55.
